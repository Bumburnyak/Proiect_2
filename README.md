OOP-Proiect2-Calculator
This simple program sets two default values (5, 3.5), for the two main variables, which store them, until the next valid INPUT (which can be made with the button, with the same text on it).
The program knows 3 different operations: summation, subtraction and multiplication (they can be selected from 3 different buttons) - after selection an information window will pop up.
With the button that says "CALC!", the program will make the last chosen operation (if nothing was selected, all the variables will have their default values; if there was an incorrect input, that value will be set the the default value, and an error message will pop up)
When the INPUT button is pressed, it is asked, if the user wants to change the suitable values.
